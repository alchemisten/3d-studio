# 3D Studio Example
This is an example application for the 3D Studio Viewer Core and UI. It is used for development and to provide usage examples.

## Development

Running `yarn start` will serve a live reload development server on `localhost:4200`,
serving the files from the `3d-studio-example` app. The base files can be used for development,
further examples for specific functionality should receive their own subfolder in
`apps/3d-studio-example/src/examples`. To run any of these examples open the corresponding
index.html file in the browser, e.g. `localhost:4200/src/examples/multiple-viewers/index.html`.
